# Therapy Application

I'm looking for a react project that can challenge me in both front-end and back-end programming. I think maybe a productivity application would be good, because it would be something that is useful for me and is basic enough for me to do on my own.

I have also had great interest in the advent of AI and large language models (LLMs). I think a great application of an LLM would be a therapist/psychiatrist that you could talk to verbally and have weekly or even daily sessions with.

I'd like to start by building the scheduling and reminders side of this application with the therapy application in mind.

## Minimum Viable Product
This application will initially be composed of three components.
1. Interactive Calendar
2. Scheduled Reminders
3. Journaling Prompt

Built around this application we will have user authentication and database.
